On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.<BR>
If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.
This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

Range: 120 feet<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.<BR>
This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p>

Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<BR><BR>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-prep">Light</button>

Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)<BR>
Duration: 1 hour<BR><BR>

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.<BR>
If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.</p>
<div class="source">Evocation<BR></div> 
</div>


<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-prep">Mending</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Casting Time: 1 minute<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S, M (two lodestones)<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.<BR>
This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.</p>
<div class="source">Transmutation<BR></div> 
</div>


<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-prep">Message</button>
<div class="content">
<p>
Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 120 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)<BR>
Duration: 1 round<BR><BR>

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.<BR>
You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.</p>
<div class="source">Transmutation<BR></div> 
</div>


<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-prep">Minor Illusion</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 30 feet<BR>
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)<BR>
Duration: 1 minute<BR><BR>

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.<BR>
If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.<BR>
If you create an image of an object--such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest--it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.<BR>
If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

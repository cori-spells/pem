<div class="content">
<BR>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 feet<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: 1 round<br><br>
You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.
If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.
This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

<button type="button" class="spell spell-row2">Find Familiar</button>
<div class="content">
<BR>
Level: 1st<BR>
Casting Time: 1 hour<BR>
Range: 10 feet<BR>
Target: An unoccupied space within range<BR>
Components: V S M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>
You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.<BR>
Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again<BR>
While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.<BR>
As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.<BR>
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

Range: 120 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot- radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.
When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.
On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.
<BR><BR>
<b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

Duration: 1 hour

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.<BR><BR>
A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.

<p>Moonlit Lady:</p>
Moonlight Champion - At 1st level, you can channel your patron's influence to become more effective in battle. You become proficient with martial weapons and apply your Charisma modifier to your armor class.
<br>The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. You can imbue radiant energy onto one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you apply this bonus to a new weapon, but only applies when you are wielding the weapon. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon’s type.

<p>Soul Step - 
Starting at 1st level, you can vanish in a shimmer of moonlight when you kill or render a creature unconscious. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action to teleport up to half your movement to an unoccupied space you can see and make a single melee attack to a creature within range.
</p>

<p>Radiant Well - 
Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project searing moonlight from your weapon in an aura 10 feet around you. When a creature moves into the aura’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws take radiant damage equal to your proficiency bonus and suffer disadvantage on ability checks.  A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and does not suffer disadvantage.

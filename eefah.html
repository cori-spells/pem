Components: V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)<BR>
Duration: 1 minute<BR><BR>
The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature’s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn’t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.</p>
</div>


<h3 style="color:#0a014f">Invocation Spells:</h3>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-inv">Chromatic Orb</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 90 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 50 gp)<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

You hurl a 4-inch-diameter sphere of energy at a creature that you can see within range. You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 3d8 damage of the type you chose.
<BR><BR>
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
</div>


<button type="button" class="spell spell-inv">Color Spray</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Self (15-foot cone)<BR>
Components: V, S, M<BR>
Duration: 1 round<BR><BR>

A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10, the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can’t see).
<BR><BR>
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for the creature to be affected.
<BR><BR>
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-inv">Cure Wounds</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-inv">Disguise Self</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: 1 hour<BR><BR>

You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
<BR><BR>
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-inv">Dissonant Whispers</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Components: V<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.
<BR><BR>
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-inv">Healing Word</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 bonus action<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Components: V<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
<BR><BR>

<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour<BR><BR>

You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.
<BR><BR>
Aquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills, and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
<BR><BR>
Change Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also don’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.
<BR><BR>
Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</p>
</div>


<button type="button" class="spell spell-ritual">Blur</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Components: V<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<BR><BR>

Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-ritual">Chaos Blade</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Self <BR>
Components: V, S, M (a hopelessly tangled ball of wire) <BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes <BR><BR>
By hopelessly attempting to unravel a ball of wire you force it into the rough shape of a miniature weapon.  It then transforms into rippling rainbow of destruction in the shape of a weapon of your choice that you wield magically. <BR><BR>
Once per round you can use it to make a melee spell attack against a target. A successful hit does e 1D6 Acid + 1D6 Force+ 1D6 Radiant damage plus your spell casting modifier as magical slashing or bludgeoning or piercing damage (your choice). You can also roll on the random energy type table 3 times if you want. <BR><BR>
If the blade is dropped it disappears but can be re-summoned for the duration with a bonus action.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-ritual">Fortune's Favor</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 minute<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (a white pearl worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)<BR>
Duration: 1 hour<BR><BR>

You impart latent luck to yourself or one willing creature you can see within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

<p><B>Ring of Radiance</b>:<BR>
This ring appears to be a normal golden or silver ring, but when you are attuned to it you can feel a light pressure as if there is something spinning inside of the ring.
<BR>
Hidden Bow. When you take the attack action on your turn, in place of an attack, you can pretend to pull something from the ring, as if you are pulling back the string of a bow. You then make an ranged spell attack with the ring. When you make the spell's attack, you do so with a bonus of +6. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 radiant damage. You remain hidden from enemies when using this effect if you already were, even from target regardless whether you hit or missed. If you roll a 20 on the attack roll, the damage dealt is 24 instead of the doubled damage dice normal for a critical hit.


<BR><BR>
<B>+1 Bracelet (Rod) of the Pact Keeper</b>:<BR>
Rod, uncommon (requires attunement by a warlock)<BR>
While holding this rod, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your warlock spells.

<b>Glamoured Studded Leather</b>:<BR>
While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

<BR><BR>
The staff has 20 Charges for the following Properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended Charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to Attack and damage roll but loses all other Properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8 + 2 Charges.
<BR><BR>
Power Strike: When you hit with a melee Attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

Lightning Bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), Magic Missile (1 charge), Ray of Enfeeblement (1 charge), or Wall of Force (5 charges).
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
You have a 50 percent chance to instantly Travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the Effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of Charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of Origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
<BR><BR>
Distance from Origin — Damage:<BR>
10 ft. away or closer — 8 x the number of Charges in the staff<BR>
11 to 20 ft. away — 6 x the number of Charges in the staff<BR>
21 to 30 ft. away — 4 x the number of Charges in the staff<BR></p>

<b>Abacus Ring of Storage</b> <BR>
This enchanted ring is a tool, an instrument of mathematics. A student at a wizard's college designed the ring to help him keep track of numbers but later enchanted it to hold his spell energy. You can use an action to store a spell slot, or any number of psi points or ki points, into the ring. The slot or psi points are then absorbed into it as spell levels, psi points, or ki points respectively. The ring can hold a <b>maximum of 4 spell levels</b>, psi points, or ki points and you can use them to cast your spells and to activate your psionic abilities or ki point abilities.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Eldritch Blast</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 feet<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br><br>
A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.
<br><br>
<b>USE:</b><BR>
Eldritch Blast (two beams): +9 to hit, 1d10+5 dmg per blast</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Guidance</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<BR><BR>

You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Healing Light</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting time: 1 bonus action (note: this is not actually a spell, therefore I can use it + cast a spell)<BR>
Range 60ft<BR>
die pool: 10d6<BR><BR>
As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once is 5. Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total.
<BR>
Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.</p></div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Light</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Components: V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)<br>
Duration: 1 hour<br><br>

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.
<br><br>
If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Mage Hand</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 30 feet<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: 1 minute<BR><BR>

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.
<BR><BR>
You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
<BR><BR>
The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Mending</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 minute<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S, M (two lodestones)<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.
<BR><BR>
This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.</p></div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Minor Illusion</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 30 feet<BR>
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)<BR>
Duration: 1 minute<BR><BR>

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
<BR><BR>
If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
<BR><BR>
If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
<BR><BR>
If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Sacred Flame</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.
<BR><BR>
<B>USE:</b><BR>
Dex save vs 17, 2d8+5 dmg on fail</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Shillelagh</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 bonus action<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)<BR>
Duration: 1 minute<BR><BR>

The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature’s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn’t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.</p></div>

<h3 style="color:#0a014f">Invocation Spells:</h3>
<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-inv">Disguise Self</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>1st-level illusion<BR>
Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: 1 hour<BR><BR>

You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
<BR><BR>
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.<BR><BR><BR>
Mask of Many Faces: You can cast Disguise Self at will, without expending a spell slot.</p></div>


<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-inv">Gift of the Protectors</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.
<BR><BR>
When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to O hit points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 hit point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a long rest.
<BR>
As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching it.</p>
</div>

<h3 style="color:#0a014f">Rituals:</h3>
<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-ritual">Find Familiar</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 hour<BR>
Range: 10 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
<BR><BR>
Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
<BR><BR>
When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.
<BR><BR>
While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
<BR><BR>
As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
<BR><BR>
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-ritual">Identify</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 minute<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.
<BR><BR>
If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.</p>
</div>

<h3 style="color:#0a014f">Real Spells:</h3>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-spells">Charm Person</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>1st-level enchantment<BR>
Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 30 feet<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: 1 hour<BR><BR>
You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.
<BR><BR>
<B>USE:</b><BR>
Wis Save vs 17, can charm up to 5 creatures</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-spells">CounterSpell</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>3rd-level abjuration<BR>
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Components: S<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.
<BR><BR>
<B>USE:</b><BR>
If spell is below 5th level, cancel it immediately. If spell is over, CHA check vs 10+[spell level]</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-spells">Cure Wounds</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>1st-level evocation<BR>
Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-spells">Flame Strike</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
<BR><BR>
<B>USE:</b><BR>
10ft radius, Dex save vs 17. 4d6 fire + 4d6 radiant + 5 dmg, half on save
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-spells">Flock of Familiars</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>2nd-level conjuration<BR>
Casting Time: 1 minute<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: 1 hour<BR>
<BR><BR>
You temporarily summon three familiars – spirits that take animal forms of your choice. Each familiar uses the same rules and options for a familiar conjured by the Find Familiar spell. All the familiars conjured by this spell must be the same type of creature (celestials, fey, or fiends; your choice). If you already have a familiar conjured by the Find Familiar spell or similar means, then one fewer familiars are conjured by this spell.
<BR><BR>
Familiars summoned by this spell can telepathically communicate with you and share their visual or auditory senses while they are within 1 mile of you.
<BR><BR>
When you cast a spell with a range of touch, one of the familiars conjured by this spell can deliver the spell, as normal. However, you can cast a touch spell through only one familiar per turn.
<BR><BR>
<B>USE:</b><BR>
Summon 6 familiars (5 if I currently have one), they can be any familiar option.</p>
</div>


<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-spells">Major Image</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>3rd-level illusion<BR>
Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 120 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
<BR><BR>
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).
<BR><BR>
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
<BR><BR>
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p>
</div>


<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-spells">Misty Step</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>2nd-level conjuration<BR>
Casting Time: 1 bonus action<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Components: V<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR>
<BR><BR>
Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-spells">Shatter</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>2nd-level evocation<BR>
Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (a chip of mica)<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous
<BR><BR>
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.
<BR><BR>
A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.
<BR><BR>
<B>USE:</b><BR>
10ft radius, Con save vs 17. 6d8 thunder dmg, half on success</p>
</div>


<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-spells">Suggestion</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 30 feet<BR>
Components: V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours<BR><BR>

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
<BR><BR>
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it purses the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
<BR><BR>
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t preformed.
<BR>
If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-spells">Vampiric Touch</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>3rd-level necromancy<BR>
Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
<BR><BR>
The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.
<BR><BR>

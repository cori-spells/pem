<button type="button" class="collapsible">Compelled Duel</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Casting Time: 1 Bonus Action<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: V<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>
You attempt to compel a creature into a duel.
One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn’t restrict the target’s movement for that turn.
<BR><BR>
The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.</p>

Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>
A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

<div class="content">
  <p>Casting time: 1 action <BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Components: V,S <BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<BR><BR>
For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.
The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>

Range: 30 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (a small silver mirror)<BR>
Duration: 1 minute<BR><BR>
You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.<BR>
If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.</p>
<div class="source">Abjuration</div></div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Sleep</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 90ft<BR>
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)<BR>
Duration: 1 minute<BR><BR>
This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8, the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).<BR><BR>
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.<BR><BR>
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

<h3 style="color:#0a014f">2nd Level:</h3>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-inv">Find Steed</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 10 minutes<BR>
Range: 30 feet<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>
You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.<BR>
When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.
While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.<BR>
You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.</p><div class="source">Conjuration</div></div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-inv">Lesser Restoration</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>
You touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.</p>
<div class="source">Abjuration</div></div>


<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-inv">Locate Object</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Components: V, S, M (a forked twig)<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<BR><BR>
Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object's location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.<BR>
The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close--within 30 feet--at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.
This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.</p>
<div class="source">Divination</div></div>



<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-inv">Magic Weapon</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 bonus action<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour<BR><BR>
You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.
<BR><BR>
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.</p>
<div class="source">Abjuration</div></div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-inv">Zone of Truth</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: 10 minutes<BR><BR>
You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.<br>
An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p>
<div class="source">Enchantment</div></div>


<h3 style="color:#0a014f">Paladin Abilities:</h3>
<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-inv">Lay on Hands</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Touch<BR>
HP Pool: 25<BR><BR>
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.<BR>
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.<BR>
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.<BR>
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p></div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-inv">Divine Sense</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Uses: 5 per long rest<BR><BR>
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.
<BR><BR>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p></div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible collapsible-inv">Channel Divinity</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Uses: 1 per short rest<BR>
Emissary of Peace. You can use your Channel Divinity to augment your presence with divine power. As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the next 10 minutes.
<BR><CENTER>OR</CENTER><BR>Rebuke the Violent. You can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke those who use violence. Immediately after an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p></div>

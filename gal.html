<button type="button" class="spell spell-cantrip">Mage Hand</button>
<div class="content">
Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 30 feet<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: 1 minute<BR><BR>

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.
<BR><BR>
You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
<BR><BR>
The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

<button type="button" class="spell spell-cantrip">Minor Illusion</button>
<div class="content">
Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 30 feet<BR>
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)<BR>
Duration: 1 minute<BR><BR>

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
<BR><BR>
If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
<BR><BR>
If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
<BR><BR>
If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

<h3 style="color:#0a014f">Item Shit:</h3>
<button type="button" class="spell spell-spells">Vest (Disguise Self)</button>
<div class="content">
Vest of the Dapper Gambler (Attuned, uncommon)):  This is a vest in its natural form appears to be a very snazzy, ornately embroidered vest.  The vest acts as Hat of Disguise, allowing Disguise Self at will.</div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-spells">Ring (Invisible Eye)</button>
<div class="content">
Ring of Cat’s Third Eye (Attuned, rare):  This is a gaudy, ring of a silvery/white metal with a 1 caret tiger-eye gem (it is not silver you know as you have mild silver allergy).  The Ring allows you (with action to release) to send out an invisible/intangible eye.  The caster can (w/bonus action) move the eye 60 feet / round.  The maximum duration the eye can be used is 1 hour/ long rest.  The eye is intangible and can pass thorough solid objects as difficult terrain (but is stopped by same materials as clairvoyance / scrying spells).  The Caster can see through the eye which has Darkvision of 60 feet.  The caster’s eye (on the ring hand) goes blind and gets the slit pupal of a Cat’s eye while it is being used (and they suffer -2  on all ranged attacks and such that depend on depth perception).  The eye can be seen via detect invisible, and instantly shut off for full day by use of a dispel magic spell. </div>


<h3 style="color:#0a014f">Hatband Shit:</h3>
<button type="button" class="spell spell-spells">General</button>
<div class="content">
The Hat-Band of That Creepy Fucking Doll (Attuned, legendary; req. attunement by caster)
It is a circular band of woven metal wire of white/burnished metal (nickle?) into which are woven many purple amethyst raw / flawed gems.  It stretches to fit whomever binds with it.
<BR><BR>
You picked this up from a couple of years ago in a very ancient crypt in mountains north of Port Zoom. Specifically from an ancient wraith trapped in a creepy fucking ceramic animatronic doll. You beat the doll in a game of dice (which you cheated on, of course). After you beat it, the doll allowed/asked you to remove the band from the Doll’s head. After which point the doll became complete inanimate/dead (which you made sure of). After which you then got out of there very quickly.
<BR><BR>
The headband/hatband provides the several complex but very useful abilities
The following specific things are important:
<LI>The abilities are NOT spells.  They do not have any VSM components, but are mental actions
<LI>The headband holds 5 Charges, which re-fresh at rate of D4 charges per long rest
<LI>You can also fill the headband’s ‘battery’ by spells at equivalence of 1 charge/spell level, which take spell casting actions and require V,S components.

The target knows they are being contacted and the “voice” of the person reaching out.  They can accept or not and you do not know if they “rejected” or if nobody was home.  To be very clear, no fishing or attempt to use this as a detection mechanism for entities in an area.  Nope, be ready to be disappointed.

<button type="button" class="spell spell-spells">I feel ya Bro</button>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-spells">You feel me Bro</button>
<div class="content">
Charges: 1 charge<BR>
Range: 30 feet<BR>
Duration 1 min (conc)<BR><BR>
Allows you project desired emotion to an individual creature you can make visual eye contact with.  Successful casting of the effect gives caster advantage on any Charisma based skill check for duration.mThe target gets CHA save vs Caster DC. Successful save of 5+ allows the target to realize a mental/emotional intrusion attempt occurred.nThere is no awareness of such even after end of the effect unless they act against normal behavior, or best interest (i.e. if you do something the DM feels is “shady/criminal”).  
</div>

<div class="content">
Charges: 3 charge<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Duration 1 min (conc)<BR><BR>
Adds +4 bonus to Deception checks; Enables use of Deception to resist attempts to read mind or emotions or such.

</div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-spells">Somebody Else’s Problem</button>
<div class="content">
Charges: 3 charge<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Area of Effect: 30ft<BR>
Duration 1 min (conc)<BR><BR>
For the duration you become innocuous and unimportant to everyone in the radius who fails a Charisma save.  You become ‘socially invisible’.  You can take actions which are non-threatening, and do not violate the tone of the people’s situation or threaten anyone or cause harm to anyone.  Doing such an action breaks the effect for everyone in the radius.  The field travels with you for the duration.  If alarm from one individual allows others to make new save.  If the individuals are in combat or conflict with you, they get advantage on the saving throw.  If you remain innocuous and are not an obvious intrusion, then new folks entering are or old folks exiting area get disadvantage on the saves. (Yea this one is very nice, but is best on only 1-2 guards)
</div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-spells">Hey Can I Ask You A Favor?</button>
<div class="content">
Charges: 3 charge<BR>
Range: 30ft (must have eye contact)<BR>
Duration 8 hours (conc)<BR><BR>
This basically is a Suggestion spell, but you have to make eye contact with the target. <BR><BR>
2nd-level enchantment

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
<BR><BR>
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it purses the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
<BR><BR>
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t preformed.
<BR><BR>
If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

<button type="button" class="spell spell-noprep">Detect Magic</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Components: V, S<BR>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<BR><BR>

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.
<BR><BR>
The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

<button type="button" class="spell spell-noprep">Find Familiar</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Casting Time: 1 hour<BR>
Range: 10 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.<BR><BR>

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.<BR><BR>

When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.<BR><BR>

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
<BR><BR>
You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.
<BR><BR>
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

<button type="button" class="spell spell-noprep">Ice Knife</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Components: S, M (a drop of water or piece of ice)<BR>
Duration: Instantaneous<BR><BR>

You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of the point where the ice exploded must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-noprep">Shield</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell<BR>
Range: Self<BR>
Components: V, S<BR><BR><BR>
Duration: 1 round<BR><BR>

An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-noprep">Unseen Servant</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Casting Time: 1 action<BR>
Range: 60 feet<BR>
Components: V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)<BR>
Duration: 1 hour<BR><BR>

This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
<BR><BR>
Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.
<BR><BR>
If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

<h3 style="color:#0a014f">Blood Maledicts</h3>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-class">Blood Curse of the Eyeless</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Casting Time: Reaction<BR>

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack, you can use your reaction to roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature’s roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack hits or misses. The creature is immune to this curse if it is immune to the blinded condition.
<BR><BR>
Amplify. You apply this curse to all the creature’s attack rolls until the end of the creature’s turn. You roll separately for each affected attack.
</p></div>

<button type="button" class="spell spell-class">Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Casting Time: Reaction<BR>
When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to instill that creature with a final act of aggression. The creature immediately makes one weapon attack against a target of your choice within its range.
<BR><BR>
Amplify. You can first cause the cursed creature to move up to half its speed, and you grant a +5 bonus to its attack roll.

<b>Arrow-Catching Shield</b> (attunement):  <BR><BR>
<b>Sun Blade </b>(attunement): This item appears to be a Longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a Bonus Action to cause a blade of pure Radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic Longsword has the Finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the sun blade.<BR>

You gain a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an Undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. <BR>

The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.<BR><BR>

<b>Gloves of Knocking</b>: Wondrous Item, uncommon
These brown leather gloves look completely innocuous to the naked eye, but an Identify spell reveals them to be Gloves of Knocking. Whenever the wearer knocks on a door, chest, box, gate, or anything else that can be locked, the DM rolls a d20. On a 10 or higher, the gloves cast the Knock spell with no material or somatic components. On a 9 or lower, nothing happens. The wearer is not aware of the outcome of the roll. The gloves can successfully cast Knock (meaning a roll of 10 or higher on a locked door or the Arcane Lock spell) twice a day. They recharge fully at the next dawn.
<BR><BR>
<b>Bone Wand of Healing</b> (attunement):  This wand made of sturdy, engraved bone has 9 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the healing word spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
<BR>
The wand regains 1d8 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
